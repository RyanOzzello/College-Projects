# Thompson Sampling
## Context
This is a problem assigned as homework for CSCI 312A Computational Statistics at Houghton College under Professor Wei Hu. 
## Task
Compare e-greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling algorithms in a blog to Top-Two Thompson Sampling described in Algorithm 1 on page 10 of the paper listed below. Cells 25-30 are my adaptation of the blog's code and my implementation of this algorithm with its comparison.
