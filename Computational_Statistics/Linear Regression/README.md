# Comparing Classification Algorithms Using Hypothesis Testing
## Context
This is a problem assigned as homework for CSCI 312A Computational Statistics at Houghton College under Professor Wei Hu. 
## Task
Practice statistical analysis by building and evaluating a linear model using confidence intervals and normality tests.
## Solution
Using gradient descent with a mean squared error function, I have completed a basic linear model. Performance was determined and evaluated by comparing estimates to actuals as well as using confidence intervals at various levels. Some exploration with the data reveals that the distribution of predicted linear parameters is not normally distributed.
