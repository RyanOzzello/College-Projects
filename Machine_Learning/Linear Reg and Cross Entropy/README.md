# Applying Gradient Descent and Cross Entropy Methods
## Context
This is a problem assigned as homework for CSCI 345A Machine Learning at Houghton College under Professor Wei Hu. 
## Task
Practice Python object oriented programming, applying gradient descent, and implementing a cross entropy.
## Solution
I developed a linear model using a Python class and was able to extract the gradient descent components of the model for an arbitrary different use. Additionally, I was able to implement a cross entropy algorithm.
