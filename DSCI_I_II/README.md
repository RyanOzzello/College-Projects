## Project Descriptions
**Heart_Rate (Video Proccessing)**: Detect the heart rate of someone with a video of their thumb. I used image analytics to detect small fluctuations in the red values of the frames which coincide with blood flowing into and out of a thumb. 

**Area (Image Analysis)**: Measure the area of a cutting board from an image of it on top of a 8.5' x 11' piece of paper using relative pixel counts and masking.

**Friends (Exploratory/Descriptive Data Analysis)**: Explore a dataset about friends based on gender.

**Squares (Image Object Detection)**: Detected squares in images using statistical analyses.

**Cross Listed Courses (Graphical Analysis)**: Create graphical representations of cross listed courses at college which can be useful for course selection.
