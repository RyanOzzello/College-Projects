## Project Descriptions
**Fiducials (Contour Hierarchy Analysis)**: Detect different levels of contour hierarchy in a fiducial for it to be used to callibrate multiple cameras in 3D.

**Barcode (Image Analysis)**: Detect and read barcodes using image analysis and crop the image to the barcode.

**Tesseract (Video Analysis)**: Get more information out of a video (rocket launch and sports tournament videos) with tesseract by extracting key data, such as rocket altitude and velocity, and plotting/cleaning it in python.
