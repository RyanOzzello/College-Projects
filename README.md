# Class Projects
A few coding exercises and projects from Houghton College.

## Classes
**Comutational Statistics**: Computational statistics course introduces computational methods to solve statistical problems. The topics will include: classical tests, statistical modeling, regression, analysis of variance an covariance, analysis of count data and proportion data,time series analysis, survival analysis, Monte Carlo methods.

**Machine Learning**: This course provides a broad introduction to a machine learning, which teaches computer programs to extract knowledge from data. The topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, classification, regression, neural networks, and support vector machines), probabilistic learning, unsupervised learning, evolutionary learning, and reinforcement learning.

**DSCI I/II**: Introduces the data science process; focusing on data collection and storage, data processing, data mining, learning, and analysis: pattern learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, statistical learning, data streaming learning, data visualization, and communication.Also looks at the legal and ethical issues in the full life cycle of data science. Data Science I and Data Science II together intend to teach the full spectrum of data science.

**Image Data**: Explores the collection, processing, analysis, and application of image data including camera technology, image processing algorithms, 3D environment modeling, object identification, and image classification. 

**Senior Capstone: Computer Science**: Reviews, practices, and explores main concepts in the field of computer science. We dove deep into cutting edge reinforcement learning research on top of approaching unique computer science problems to develop creative solutions.  

**Computer Science Research**: Researched Meta-Learning using Reptile and MAML algorithms. We used these meta learning algorithms with an evolutionary strategy to enable reinforcement learning algorithms to learn more quickly with significantly less data or iterations.
